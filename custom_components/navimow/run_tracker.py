"""FEAT-05 step (b) — pure run/zone tracker fed by /location packets.

Design: FEAT-05 SPIKE record + Fable implementation brief on #43.

Zero HA imports so the tracker is unit-testable without spinning up the
core loop, matching the testability pattern of `location.py`. The
coordinator instantiates one tracker per device and forwards:

- `process_type2(parsed)` — for every type-2 item accepted by the
  layer-1 ordering guard (FEAT-05 step (a)).
- `process_vehicle_state(vs)` — for every accepted type-1 item whose
  `vehicleState` differs from the previously seen value.
- `tick(now=None)` — periodically (coordinator tick cadence, ~30 s) so
  the sustained-60 s docked-idle interruption detector can fire even
  when no MQTT traffic is arriving.

Every call returns a list of `Event` records the caller can dispatch to
Home Assistant. Step (c) turns those into HA events + entity updates;
step (b) verifies them via `list[Event]` returns in the test suite.

Guard layers (Fable brief 2026-07-03 16:57 UTC):
- Layer 1 lives in the coordinator (`/location` `time` monotonicity per
  stream) and is not seen here — this module trusts its input.
- Layer 2: `mowingWeekArea` is monotonically non-decreasing across the
  ISO week. Rejection is exempted when the payload crosses an ISO
  Monday 00:00 UTC boundary (the counter resets there).
- Layer 3: for an open run, `|wk - sub - wk₀| ≤ 0.5` m², where `wk₀` is
  captured on the first packet of the run. Same ISO-Monday exemption;
  when the exemption fires wk₀ is re-anchored from the new packet.

State machine (converged, authoritative per the brief; BUG-09 revised):

    IDLE ─fresh type-2─▶ RUNNING [run_started]
    RUNNING ─vs ∈ {1,2,3,6}─▶ PAUSED_DOCKED
    PAUSED_DOCKED ─fresh type-2, strict progress─▶ RUNNING   (resume)
    RUNNING/PAUSED_DOCKED ─mp ≥ MP_COMPLETION_THRESHOLD (99)
        ∧ vs ∈ {1,2,3}─▶ COMPLETED [run_finished]
    RUNNING/PAUSED_DOCKED ─fresh reset (sub < last, sub < ceiling)─▶
        close open run [run_finished], open new run [run_started]
    PAUSED_DOCKED ─vs ∈ {1,3} sustained 60 s─▶ INTERRUPTED
        [run_finished]
    COMPLETED/INTERRUPTED ─fresh type-2 with strict progress─▶
        reopen same run, RUNNING [run_reopened]
    COMPLETED/INTERRUPTED ─fresh reset (sub < ceiling)─▶ open new run

BUG-09 (2026-07-04): the observed i210 firmware never emits `mp = 100`
— tasks terminate at `mp = 99`. The completion criterion is therefore
`mp ≥ MP_COMPLETION_THRESHOLD` (99) ∧ `vs ∈ {1, 2, 3}` (docked idle /
charging / unpowered; user pause `vs = 6` excluded so a manual pause
still holds the run even at `mp = 99`). Immediate close, no debounce.
The result label is centralised in `_close_run`: `completed` iff the
last accepted `mp ≥ MP_COMPLETION_THRESHOLD`, else `interrupted` — so
every close path (fast, reset, sustained-timer) labels consistently.

A `sub` regression *above* `RESET_SUB_CEILING` is not accepted as an
immediate reset — the packet is stashed as a *pending* reset and only
promoted retroactively when the next accepted packet confirms it
coherently (B2 on #49: one anomalous packet must not destroy a live
run). Reopens require strict `sub > last_sub` progress (B1 on #49: an
echo packet after a run close must not re-fire the completion cycle).

vs=2 (charging) still holds PAUSED_DOCKED when the run has not reached
the completion threshold — a mid-run recharge pause below `mp = 99`
never times out. vs=8 (firmware-reset transient, MAP-01) is ignored.
`boundary=0` (BUG-06 sentinel) is excluded from zone accounting but
still updates run accumulators.
